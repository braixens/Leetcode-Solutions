Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repo ! 

Basically just keeping track of my solutions and stuff.

## How Solutions Are Organized

Solutions are categorized by DIFFICULTY as:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

In the future will probably add subcategories inside the folders based on the topic like Binary Search, Arrays, Hashing, Algorithms, and stuff like that

For now each file in the folder will have the commit comment as the leetcode problem number, and the solution inside with comments. Most will be in rust, may start to include others as i branch out and learn more (probably would be c++) ^_^ !
